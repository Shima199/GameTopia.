        <p>1990 was a big deal, what some would argue, is the greatest era of gaming history to date. And the year was started with the Nintendo World Championships, an event nostalgically held in the collective memory of ‘80s/’90s kids.  The transition from 2D to 3D was full of trials and tribulations, but it was a necessary one. Some of the former games are the pinnacle of their craft, and while some of the latter are pale versions of what would eventually be industry classics, others are still among the best ever made, despite the bad graphics.</p>

        <p>A sports game is a video game genre that simulates the practice of sports. Most sports have been recreated with a game, including team sports, track, and field, extreme sports and combat sports. Some games emphasize actually playing the sport (such as NBA Jam). NBA Jam (sometimes "Jam" for short) is a long-running basketball video game series based on the National Basketball Association (NBA). Initially developed as arcade games by Midway, the game found popularity with its photorealistic digitized graphics, over-the-top presentation, and exaggerated style of two-on-two basketball play.</p>
